Research takes time.<br/><br/>

Before you volunteer, it is important to know how much time is involved.<br/><br/>

Signing up to volunteer takes about 20 minutes. After that, the study takes about 20 minutes per day. Once a month, we ask follow up questions. These take about 5 minutes to complete.<br/><br/>

You decide when and how much to participate. You can stop and start your participation at any time.<br/><br/>

Transmitting data collected in this study may count against your mobile data plan. You may configure the application to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on your data plan.
