We share coded study data with qualified researchers worldwide. Who are qualified researchers?<br/><br/>

Qualified researchers must register on Synapse, our data-sharing and analysis platform. To register, researchers must tell us their name, email address, company, and location.<br/><br/>

Also, qualified researchers must write a short statement about their research. We post these statements <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4993293/wiki/392026">publicly.</a><br/><br/>

Finally, researchers must sign an oath. They agree to use the data ethically and to do no harm. They promise to not identify you or contact you without your permission. You can review the oath on Synapse.<br/><br/>

Anyone in the US or abroad can apply to become a qualified researcher. For example, doctors working at hospitals or scientists at universities. Researchers who work for commercial companies, like drug manufacturers, can apply. Private citizens can also apply.<br/><br/>

If we change these rules for any reasons we will let you know.
