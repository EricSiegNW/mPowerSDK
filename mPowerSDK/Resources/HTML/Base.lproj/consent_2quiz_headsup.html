<p>
Because this is a research study, we want volunteers to understand the purpose of the study. Also, volunteers need to understand what they will be asked to do.<br /> <br />


We will tell more about these topics in this overview. If you have questions, please contact the study sponsor by phone at +1-206-667-2129 (toll free at +1-844-822-4708) or email at PDApp@sagebase.org <br /> <br />

You should not volunteer until all of your questions are answered.<br /> <br />

At the end of this overview  there is a short quiz. You can go back to the screens describing the study as many times as you need to pass the quiz.
