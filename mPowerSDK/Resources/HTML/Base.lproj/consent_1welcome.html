How can we better manage the symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD) together? <br /><br />

People with PD have different symptoms. These symptoms can change day-to-day and over time. The purpose of this study is to help us understand the different symptoms of PD. The results of this study may help researchers develop new ways to manage PD symptoms.<br/><br/>

This study uses an app to monitor PD symptoms. Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) has developed this app to make it easier for people to participate in this research.<br /><br />

If you participate in this study, you will be asked to complete surveys and activities. The activities use your phoneâ€™s built-in sensors to collect information about your health and the symptoms of PD -- like balance and dexterity.<br /><br />

If you are over 18 years old, you can join the study. We are looking for volunteers with PD and volunteers who do not have PD (&quot;controls&quot;) to join this research study. Both groups are important to the study.</p>
