Your phone contains many sensors. For example, it has a gyroscope and an accelerometer. These sensors are also found in fitness trackers like the Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Jawbone Up. These sensors measure your physical activity.<br /><br />

With your permission we&#39;d like to add sensor data from your fitness tracker to the study. This is an optional part of the study. You can still participate in the study if you do not allow us to gather data from these sensors.<br /><br />

We will NOT access other apps on your phone. Also, we will NOT access your contacts, photos, texts, or email.
